> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).
- Open Knowledge International

Note:
Open, at least according to Open Knowledge International, means anyone can freely access, use, modify and share for any purpose the concent, data or software in question. Both the Open Source Definition and Free Software Definition are quite closely aligned, but do differ from, the above - for all intents and purposes, we can treat these as mutually interchangeable.
