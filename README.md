# Prerequisites

## What is version control?
Any method of tracking and controlling changes to a set of things, almost always files. Even editing and saving a word document under a different name (assignment.doc, assignment_draft.doc, assignment_final, assignment_final_2.doc, etc) counts; with even a dozen files, this becomes cumbersome almost immediately.

Enter Git!
